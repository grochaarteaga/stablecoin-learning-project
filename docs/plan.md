## ✅ Day 1 – Stablecoin Fundamentals
- Learned about the main types of stablecoins  
  - **Fiat-backed**: USDC, USDT (backed by cash or short-term Treasuries)  
  - **Crypto-backed**: DAI (over-collateralized with ETH or stETH)  
  - **Algorithmic**: UST (collapsed – lesson on why stability mechanisms matter)
- Understood how stablecoins maintain their peg.
- Created GitHub repository `stablecoin-learning-project`.
- Added first documentation files and committed them.

## ✅ Day 2 – Python Setup + Blockchain Connection
- Installed Python 3, created a virtual environment `.venv`.
- Installed `web3.py` and `python-dotenv`.

- Verified connection and printed the latest Sepolia block number.  


## Day 3 – Wallet Setup & Balance Reading

- Added Sepolia network in MetaMask
- Received 0.5 SepoliaETH from faucet
